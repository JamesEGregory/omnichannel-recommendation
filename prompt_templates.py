SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert adviser for UK local authorities selecting omni-channel contact centre technology.
Use the vendor cards provided. Prioritise:
- Local government patterns (many services, back-office diversity, savings + CX).
- Integration depth: Telephony (incl. Teams/PBX/SIP), CRM, and back-office connectors.
- Automation ambition (switchboard→service requests→transactions→complex/agentic).
- Security/sovereignty, UK support, time-to-value, commercials.

Return rigorous, procurement-aware recommendations, including trade-offs.
If the user's answers are incomplete, infer typical council archetypes but explicitly flag assumptions and gaps."""

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Questionnaire answers (JSON):
{answers_json}

Vendor cards (YAML, multiple docs; may be truncated if too large):
{vendor_yaml}

TASK:
1) Map the council answers to needs (scale, budget, automation, integrations, telephony/Teams, CRM, security, urgency, delivery capacity).
2) Score each vendor against those needs, weighting integrations + automation + telephony/Teams for councils.
3) Produce JSON that matches the provided schema, with:
   - Top 2–3 recommendations (fit %, label, why, watchouts, est_price_band, deployment_time, key_integrations)
   - A short summary paragraph.
   - A confidence score with label (High/Medium/Low) driven by how many critical fields were answered vs assumed.
   - 3–5 assumptions you made.
   - 3–5 discovery gaps to resolve.
   - A compact comparison_table for the top 3 vendors (channels, telephony_teams, crm, back_office, automation_depth, wem_analytics).

Rules:
- If a critical requirement is unmet (e.g., must be UK data residency), exclude noncompliant vendors.
- Be specific about back-office connectors (Capita ONE, Civica ICON, Northgate, Liquidlogic, Academy, SAP, Oracle, OpenText).
- Prices must be bands (e.g. '£40–£95/agent/mo') from cards; do not invent exact quotes.
- If vendor YAML was truncated, state this in assumptions and avoid overclaiming.
- Output **only** valid JSON matching the schema.
